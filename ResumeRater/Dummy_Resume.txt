Currently, I'm a senior attending the University of Central Florida for a Bachelors of Applied Science in Software Development and graduating August of 2018. I thought I should make a site that is essentially a resume on it's own, so I created this site to demonstrate my knowlege of both web and software development. Note that I have built most of this site from scratch. I have been learning on my own, how to make a database web server using the "LAMP" setup (Linux, Apache, Mysql (I may switch to the FireBird Database Management System), PHP). I love learning about new things, especially when it is technology or science related. I am a forward-thinking deep thinker, team player and I always bring the same enthusiasm and passion to the project at hand. That being said, I plan on going higher in college by reaching for a Masters in Computer Science specializing in Artificial Intelligence.
